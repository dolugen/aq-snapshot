## What is air inequality?

Air inequality is the unequal access to clean air. Over 90% of the world's population lives in areas with unhealthy air. [(WHO)](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health)

## How does it affect me?

### PM2.5 particles
are small enough to get into the lungs and blood stream, leading to lung and heart problems, including asthma, cancers, stroke and premature death.

It can come from airborne particles such as smoke, dust, dirt, soot, and salt. [(EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm)

### Exposure
The sources of these particles include vehicles, factories, fires, and other natural or human activity resulting in the addition of particles in the air.

Living near transportation hubs and roadways increases your exposure to unhealthy toxins.

Driving a car can give off 0.009 metric tons of Carbon Dioxide emissions per gallon. That's equivalent to burning roughly 10 lbs of coal. The average vehicle gives off about 4.6 metric tons of Carbon Dioxide a year [(EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle)  


## What can I do about it?

### Avoid Exposure
On days with higher air pollution levels, avoid going outside and strenuous activities.

Choose cleaner transportation options such as walking, biking, or public transportation. Or switch to greener vehicle options [(EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles)

### Educate Yourself
Learn more about environmental health effects in your area [(CDC)](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/InfoByLocation/)

Learn how you can reduce your emissions [(EPA calculator)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/household-carbon-footprint-calculator)

### Advocate
Talk to your family and friends about how air quality affects them. 

Participate in community and local government efforts to push for regulation that cleans the air. [(CAF)](https://www.cleanairfund.org/blog-post/how-to-run-an-effective-air-pollution-campaign-in-the-post-covid-era/)
